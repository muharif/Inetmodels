## iNetModels Python API

We have developed a python package (soon to be submitted to conda/pip) to access iNetModels programmatically. User can test the API by downloading this folder and run the Jupyter Notebook. In the jupyter notebook, user can learn to:
1. Browse the available networks in iNetModels
2. Download network edge and node tables for downstream analysis
3. Loading the network to iGraph Python.

This API is still under development. We are planning to submit the code to Conda or PIP for easier installation.
